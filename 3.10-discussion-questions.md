* Give the Big-O performance of the following code fragment:

for i in range(n):
   for j in range(n):
      k = 2 + 2

O(n^2) for a nested loop


* Give the Big-O performance of the following code fragment:

for i in range(n):
     k = 2 + 2

O(n)


* Give the Big-O performance of the following code fragment:

i = n
while i > 0:
   k = 2 + 2
   i = i // 2

O(log n) since at each iterations i is cut in half


* Give the Big-O performance of the following code fragment:

for i in range(n):
   for j in range(n):
      for k in range(n):
         k = 2 + 2

O(n^3)


* Give the Big-O performance of the following code fragment:

for i in range(n):
   k = 2 + 2
for j in range(n):
   k = 2 + 2
for k in range(n):
   k = 2 + 2

O(n), is O(3n) but the 3 can be ignored since it is constant
